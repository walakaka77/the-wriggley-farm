We’re a couple who are passionate about gardening and composting. We've been gardening and worming ever since our University days starting in 2013! Here’s a little more about us:

One of us is an animal behavior expert with a deep understanding of how animals interact with their environment. Her expertise helps us create a balanced and nurturing space for our beloved dog, Storm, as well as for our plants.

The other guy is a software delivery specialist with a keen eye for detail and problem-solving. His analytical skills are invaluable in managing our gardening projects and composting efforts, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

Together, we enjoy growing chilies and crafting our own compost. We’re eager to share our journey and learn from the community. If you have gardening tips or insights, we’d love to hear from you. Feel free to get in touch!
